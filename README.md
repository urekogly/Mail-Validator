Email Validator

This is an email validator that uses the MX DNS record to validate emails. The validator has an interactive mode where you can type in the name of a .txt file containing your email list. The validator will then validate the emails in the list and save the results in two separate files: "valid.txt" and "invalid.txt". The validator is also multithreaded, allowing you to select the number of threads to use, from 0 to 100.
